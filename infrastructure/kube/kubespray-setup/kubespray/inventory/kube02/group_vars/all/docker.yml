## Uncomment this if you want to force overlay/overlay2 as docker storage driver
## Please note that overlay2 is only supported on newer kernels
# docker_storage_options: -s overlay2

## Enable docker_container_storage_setup, it will configure devicemapper driver on Centos7 or RedHat7.
docker_container_storage_setup: false

## It must be define a disk path for docker_container_storage_setup_devs.
## Otherwise docker-storage-setup will be executed incorrectly.
# docker_container_storage_setup_devs: /dev/vdb

## Uncomment this if you have more than 3 nameservers, then we'll only use the first 3.
docker_dns_servers_strict: false

# Path used to store Docker data
docker_daemon_graph: "/var/lib/docker"

## Used to set docker daemon iptables options to true
docker_iptables_enabled: "false"

# Docker log options
# Rotate container stderr/stdout logs at 50m and keep last 5
docker_log_opts: "--log-opt max-size=50m --log-opt max-file=5"

# define docker bin_dir
docker_bin_dir: "/usr/bin"

# keep docker packages after installation; speeds up repeated ansible provisioning runs when '1'
# kubespray deletes the docker package on each run, so caching the package makes sense
docker_rpm_keepcache: 0

## An obvious use case is allowing insecure-registry access to self hosted registries.
## Can be ipaddress and domain_name.
## example define 172.19.16.11 or mirror.registry.io
# docker_insecure_registries:
#   - mirror.registry.io
#   - 172.19.16.11

## Add other registry,example China registry mirror.
# docker_registry_mirrors:
#   - https://registry.docker-cn.com
#   - https://mirror.aliyuncs.com

## If non-empty will override default system MountFlags value.
## This option takes a mount propagation flag: shared, slave
## or private, which control whether mounts in the file system
## namespace set up for docker will receive or propagate mounts
## and unmounts. Leave empty for system default
# docker_mount_flags:

## A string of extra options to pass to the docker daemon.
## This string should be exactly as you wish it to appear.
