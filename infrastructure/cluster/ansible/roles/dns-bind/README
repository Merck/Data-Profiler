Notes:

dns.yml:

    - Configures Primary DNS with dynamic update capability
    - Configures Secondary DNS and enables DNS AXFR Zone Transfer from Primary DNS
    - Configures DNS resolution on clients


dns_client_uninstall.yml:

    Use this playbook if DNS has previously been set up using this ansible role. It
    attempts to reset DNS settings to the way they were before DNS playbook install.

    It will remove all references to the internal nameservers by:

        - removing netplan configuration: /etc/netplan/99-private-nameservers.yaml
        - removing dhclient domain configuration (/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf)
        - resetting /etc/resolv.conf to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
        - removing enter and exit hooks for DHCP (/etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/dnsupdate and
                /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/dnsupdate)
        - applying netplan configuration (via netplan apply)
        - run dhclient to force refresh


Dynamic DNS:

    DHCLIENT hooks are utilized to update the internal nameserver records
    via nsupdate (included in dnsutils package).

    This is done with the custom script 'dnsupdate' which is placed in
    /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d .

    On reboot, this hook is executed and the host's current network info is
    sent to the nameserver. This update may be forced manually by running the
    command 'sudo dhclient' on any particular node, or by running the utility
    script 'dns-check.sh' .


Utility Scripts:

    dns-check.sh

        usage: dns-check-and-update.sh [ development | preview | production ]

    	function: Checks forward and reverse zone lookups on all hosts based
    	on AWS EC2 inventory. If problems are found, the script attempts to fix
    	the issues by forcing an nsupdate from that host.

    dns-update-cname-records.sh

        usage: no args

        function: Manually updates the CNAME records for the following hosts:
            - secrets.dataprofiler.com
            - container-registry.dataprofiler.com


Known issues:

    # Manual edits once Dynamic DNS has started

    Once the Primary DNS is operating with dynamic updates enabled, care must be taken
    to avoid modifying zone configuration manually. Doing so corrupts the DNS DB Cache and
    prevents the primary server from reloading the zones.

    If a manual update MUST be applied, dynamic updates must be frozen using the
    following command on the primary node:

        - rndc freeze

    Once the manual edits are completed, run the command

        - rndc thaw

    to restore Dynamic DNS updates.
