In this performance at Brooklyn Bowl, the promising New York upstarts reveal an affection for bands like Death Cab For Cutie that might go a little deeper than cute impressions. Here, the band twist lovelorn lyrics and head clenching instrumental/vocal melodies, providing the kind of affecting twine that may as well replace the heart strings for tugging on.
